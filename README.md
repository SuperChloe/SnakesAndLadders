# SnakesAndLadders
Command line Snakes and Ladders game (LHLW1WE)

Normally, Snakes and Ladders is played using dice. You can trust the user to roll the dice and input the number (from 1-6). Since you're not (yet) equipped to build a graphical interface for the game, you can trust that the user is not cheating (the user can't see the snakes or ladders).

Create a simple S&L game, where the user can start the game by choosing the board size (say, entering '5' for a 5x5 board) and level of difficulty ('E' for easy, 'M' for medium, 'H' for hard). In Easy mode, there will be more ladders than there are snakes. In Medium mode, there are equal numbers of snakes and ladders, and in Hard mode, there will be more snakes than ladders.

Two players should take turns. Each turn a player will input a dice roll result (1-6) and his token will move that many units forward. If the token hits a snake or a ladder, an appropriate message gets printed. In all cases, the player is prompted as to which cell his token moved to.
